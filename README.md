## plsql.vim syntax file

The syntax file replaces the functionality of the *plsql.vim* file that ships with vim versions 8 and earlier (it was last updated
for Oracle 9). 

> Release v20220821_1.4 (tag r1.4) of this syntax file was submitted to the *vim* maintainers for inclusion in *vim* version 9.

> Release v20220924_1.5 (tag r1.5) of this syntax file was submitted to the *vim* maintainers for inclusion in *vim* verison 9.

Relative to the original *plsql.vim*, this update adds keywords and syntax through Oracle version 19c.  It fixes Q-quote operator syntax, exponential notation and assorted oddities, plus adds optional folding.

It does away with trying to separate SQL from PL/SQL keywords unless *plsql_legacy_sql_keywords* is set.

Behavior was changed for highlight groups *plsqlSymbol* and *plsqlSQLKeyword*. If you want the original behavior, add the following to your *.vimrc* file:

```vim
let plsql_legacy_sql_keywords = 1
```
We also added highlighting for some *SqlPlus* commands and define variables.

### Folding

To turn on syntax folding, issue the following commands to enable folding and reload the syntax file:

```vim
:let plsql_fold = 1
:set syntax=plsql
```

If you habitually do not put the procedure/function name in the *END* statement of the definition, you might want to disable folding for procedures with:

```vim
:let plsql_disable_procedure_fold = 1
:set syntax=plsql
```

The reason is that it will search to the end of the file on each procedure/function declaration looking for it.  On a large file without the procedure name in closing END statement searching to the end for each match can be expensive.

In the [Installation](#installation) section there are some suggestions for your *.vimrc* file, including how to turn on folding automatically without having to open all folds every time you open a file.

Folding is defined for

* PROCEDURE/FUNCTION
* multi-line comments
* multi-line string literals including those created with the Q-quote operator
* BEGIN ... END; blocks including those that encompass the body of a procedure if the procedure is not matched
* CASE ... END conditional blocks, both SQL and PL/SQL (END CASE;)
* IF ... END IF; conditional blocks
* LOOP ... END LOOP; repeat blocks
* CURSOR ... ;
* ( ... ) parentheses groups
* *SELECT* ... *FROM* 
* *UPDATE/MERGE SET* assignments

#### Procedures and Functions Folding

Folding for Procedures and Functions is limited. It only works if the *END* statement includes the procedure/function name before the semicolon. Although Oracle makes it optional, we cannot. If you do not have the procedure/function name in the *END* statement, you can still fold the *BEGIN/END* block that comprises the procedure body, but the specification part will not fold.

One tricky thing about folding Procedures and Functions, is that if your cursor is on the top line and on that line there is an opening paren for a multi-line paren group (method parameters), and you do **zc**, the paren group will fold first.  You must move your cursor below the closing paren to fold the Procedure/Function or else use **zC** to fold both.

Independent *BEGIN/END* blocks inside the procedure body cannot fold.  If *plsqlBlock* was contained in *plsqlProcedure*, it would start at the *BEGIN* keyword of the Procedure and consume it along with the *END* keyword. There does not appear to be any way to make them coexist using methods I tried.

Local Procedures and Functions in the specification (between *IS* (or *AS*) and *BEGIN*) can fold if they meet the other criteria (named *END* statement). Unlike the outer Procedure/Function, an unmatched local method cannot fold on the *BEGIN/END* pair.

#### Parentheses Folding

One nice thing about parentheses folding is that it can work on SQL *WITH* clauses

```plsql
WITH a AS (
    SELECT
        x, y, z
    FROM mytable
)
, b AS (
    SELECT
        x, y, z
    FROM mytable
)
SELECT * from a,b
;
```

The line beginning "WITH a AS (" through the line containing ")" will fold. The line containing ",b AS (" through the line containing ")" will fold.

> if you put both the closing paren of the first *WITH* clause (aka Common Table Expression or *CTE*),
> and the opening paren of the next *CTE* on the same line, then it lumps it all into a single fold block. Too bad.

This also works with the old style Oracle inline views with the same caveat about closing and opening parens needing to be on separate lines.

For this screenshot *foldcolumn* is set to 2. You can see on the left where folds can be done and what is included in the fold.

#### *SELECT*/*FROM* Folding

If *FROM* is on a line that starts only with white space, then it will not be included in the fold. If *FROM* is on the same line with something inside the select list, it will be scooped up into the fold (which is probably not what you want).  In the preferred case only the line with *SELECT* and all lines up until the line with *FROM* will fold.  *SELECT*/*FROM* pairs in column list scalar subqueries will be consumed recursively and can fold as well (though it seems unlikely you would want to considering you are returning a single value in the select list).

As with the example in [Parentheses Folding](#parentheses-folding), if the *SELECT* keyword shares a line with a prior foldable end match, such as a closing paren, then it will collapse with it into a single fold. That makes this example ugly:

```plsql
WITH a AS (
    SELECT ...
    FROM abc
    WHERE ...
) SELECT     abc
            ,def
            ,ghi
FROM a;
```
If you fold the Parentheses group starting on any line, it will fold everything up until the bottom *FROM* as it consumes the second logical fold group (SELECT/FROM) along with the Parentheses group.

#### *UPDATE/MERGE SET* Folding

The comma separated list of assignments after the *SET* keyword, whether in an *UPDATE* statement or in the *WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN UPDATE* section of a *MERGE*, can be a long list. We can
fold the assignments.

Other components of a *MERGE* are inside parentheses which can be folded.

If the term that ends the *SET* assignments is on a separate line, then it is not included in the fold.  This is similar to the discussion about *FROM* in [*SELECT*/*FROM* Folding](#selectfrom-folding).

## lee.vim color file

The colors file *lee.vim* is a Black background theme.

*lee.vim* provides separate colors for *Numbers* and *Boolean*, *Constant* (strings) and *Character* (double quoted identifiers) while the common color files combine them. 

> The rational for separating *Character* to a different color is that double quoted literal strings are mapped to *Character*.
> Double Quoted literals in SQL are identifiers (object names) that are case sensitive and may contain spaces. Since they are really
> table and column names, or column aliases, in your program rather than string literal data, they deserve a color
> closer to what you use for *Normal*. *lee.vim* makes them Cyan which is close to the Electric Blue of *Normal*.

*lee.vim* folds *Repeat* and *Conditional* groups into *Statement* while the common color files show them in a different color.

I use the same color scheme via a [ruby-rouge plsql lexer](https://lee-lindley.github.io/plsql/sql/2022/03/20/Ruby-Rouge-Lexer-PLSQL.html) in [my blog](https://lee-lindley.github.io/).

## Screenshots

### New PL/SQL syntax file with *lee.vim* color file

SQL and PL/SQL keywords are the same color. You can choose separate colors for Oracle Reserved keywords from Oracle non-Reserved keywords if desired (Statement, Keyword), but we do not try to separate SQL and PL/SQL keywords. The original implementation did so without considering context (which would greatly complicate the lexer), and the result seems more distracting than useful.  You can get it back with the *legacy* setting discussed above if you prefer it.

### Original PL/SQL syntax file with *lee.vim* color file

Notice the distinction between some SQL keywords and others. Also note some parsing is broken, in particular the Q-quote operator (q'!text!').

## Installation

The files are placed under your home directory. Do not put them in the common location under Program Files (or /usr/local/share unless you know what you are doing) because those can be clobbered by a reinstall or upgrade of vim.


If you are on Unix, create directories *~/.vim/ftplugin*, *~/.vim/syntax* and *~/.vim/colors* if they do not already exist. On windows it is your %USERPROFILE% folder (usually C:\Users\YourLoginName) and below that *vimfiles/ftplugin*, *vimfiles/syntax*, *vimfiles/colors*.

* Install *syntax/plsql.vim* into *~/.vim/syntax* (or *%USERPROFILE%/vimfiles/syntax* on Windows).
* Install *ftplugin/plsql.vim* into *~/.vim/ftplugin* (or *%USERPROFILE%/vimfiles/ftplugin* on Windows).
* If you want the colors file demonstrated in this README, install *colors/lee.vim* from the repository into *~/.vim/colors* (or *%USERPROFILE%/vimfiles/colors* on Windows).

These configuration files can be used independently. *plsql.vim* works just fine with *elflord* and other color schemes that ship with vim. *lee.vim* uses some highlight groups the common color files do not while folding together some that the common color groups separate. This is discussed in section [lee.vim color file](#leevim-color-file).

You might want to add the following to your *.vimrc* (or *_vimrc* file on windows):

```vim
syntax enable
colorscheme lee
au BufNewFile,BufRead *.sql,*.pls,*.tps,*.tpb,*.pks,*.pkb,*.pkg,*.trg set filetype=plsql
au BufNewFile,BufRead *.sql,*.pls,*.tps,*.tpb,*.pks,*.pkb,*.pkg,*.trg syntax on
```

You could also make the colorscheme switch with an auto command upon syntax file load rather than setting it for all files. If so it would need to be after the line that turns syntax on. For example if you want colorscheme **elflord** for most files, but **lee** for Oracle files, then...

```vim
colorscheme elflord
au BufNewFile,BufRead *.sql,*.pls,*.tps,*.tpb,*.pks,*.pkb,*.pkg,*.trg set filetype=plsql
au BufNewFile,BufRead *.sql,*.pls,*.tps,*.tpb,*.pks,*.pkb,*.pkg,*.trg syntax on
au Syntax plsql colorscheme lee
```

If you want to turn on folding, and optionally open all folds when the file is loaded (default when you turn on folding is to start with all folds closed), add the following to *.vimrc*.  The order matters. *plsql_fold* must be set before loading the syntax file and the auto command to open all folds (zR) must come after the auto commands to load the syntax file.

```vim
let plsql_fold = 1
" let plsql_disable_procedure_fold = 1
au BufNewFile,BufRead *.sql,*.pls,*.tps,*.tpb,*.pks,*.pkb,*.pkg,*.trg set filetype=plsql
au BufNewFile,BufRead *.sql,*.pls,*.tps,*.tpb,*.pks,*.pkb,*.pkg,*.trg syntax on
au Syntax plsql colorscheme lee
au Syntax plsql normal zR
au Syntax plsql set foldcolumn=2 "optional if you want to see choosable folds on the left
```

As noted in the [Folding](#folding) section you may encounter files where vim takes a very long time to parse the syntax of a plsql file. The most likely cause is that the code author does not put procedure names on the closing END statement of the procedure. Although I do so religiously, many people do not. If I'm working on someone else's code I may put a project level *.vimlocal* file in the directory containing this variable setting:

```vim
:let plsql_disable_procedure_fold = 1
```

In my main *.vimrc* or *_vimrc* I have a directive to read any local settings file but not complain if there is not one present. This must come before the autocommands to load the syntax file.

```vim
silent! so .vimlocal
```

I do not like syntax colors getting in my way when looking at a diff. I also prefer all the text that is the same to fade into the background a bit.  For that purpose the *torte* colorscheme serves well. This code from my *.vimrc* selects *torte* and avoids syntax highlighting when we are running a diff, while implementing most of the options discussed above when we are not running a diff.


```vim
" Allow for local set/let of variables
silent! so .vimlocal
if &diff 
    syntax off
    colorscheme torte
else
    colorscheme lee
    syntax enable
    let plsql_fold = 1
    au BufNewFile,BufRead *.sql,*.pls,*.tps,*.tpb,*.pks,*.pkb,*.pkg,*.trg set filetype=plsql
    au BufNewFile,BufRead *.sql,*.pls,*.tps,*.tpb,*.pks,*.pkb,*.pkg,*.trg syntax on
    " au Syntax plsql colorscheme lee
    au Syntax plsql normal zR
    au Syntax plsql set foldcolumn=2 "optional if you want to see choosable folds on the left
endif
```
